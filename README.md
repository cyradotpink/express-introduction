This is the example code for a presentation I did for uni as an introduction to Express.js.\
Find the presentation (Google slides) [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YUWuuBi8OquN6XPbjGAXVEkPsSuHOOceEUiPX85jwRQ).\
Note that it's in German.\
\
To give these examples a try, clone the repository and run `npm install` from within the package directory.\
Then run the main.js files with node.
